                    Dear Joey, My child wants a computer for Christmas. Should I get one?
                </div>

       <div class="col-md-4">Dear 5a1nt N1ck, <br> I think It's perfectly logical for you to have concerns, 
       but you shouldn't worry about your child. I would say the only reason one shouldn't get their
       child a computer is for a financial reason. A good computer can be quite expensive,
       but if you have the funds, it is a worthwhile investment not only for your child's 
       current tasks, but for your child's Future.

       <div class="col-md-4">Computers, even if they are provided through the school are a wondrous 
       learning tool for students. It allows them to explore their own creativity and do their school
       work more efficiently. Unfortunately, some schools feel the need to block specific websites
       that would be used by students for positive reasons. I have personally run into this problem
       with some programming and website hosting sites that the school blocked. At home with their own
       computer, students can use these websites. 
        </div>
       <div class="col-md-4">Christmas is a large time for spending money, and a computer has
       the potential to be equivalent to the normal price you pay for everything. I would 
       suggest that you tell your child that, if they get a computer for Christmas, that 
       it may be the only gift, or that they may not get as many as normal. Christmas is a
       time for giving, but not for going broke. We all need to remember the true holiday
       spirit of being together over getting presents. A computer is a wonderful useful gift,
       but it means nothing without friends and family.
