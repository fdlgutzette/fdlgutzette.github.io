           <h1 id="title">Christmas Has Become Too Object Oriented</h1>
       <div class="col-md-4">No matter what you say or what you do, you can't 
       stop thinking about what you are going to get for Christmas. I believe
       that the Holiday season has become too object oriented. The average family
       spends one thousand dollars a year on christmas gifts. Expectations pressure
       you into buying gifts for other people, even if you don't know them that well.<br>

       <div class="col-md-4"><img src="pictures/gift.png"><br>I found myself in a position where i felt obligated to 
       participate in a Secret Santa event. The more I think about the concept of 
       Secret Santa, the more meaningless it is. You draw names out of a hat for
       someone that you barely know, then get them a meaningless gift, because
       you can't think of what they would possibly like.
        </div>
       <div class="col-md-4">I believe that the concept of needing to receive to
       give to others is ridiculous. If we need items to bring us together then
       there is no point to being together. The holiday season isn't about tangible
       item, but the intangible like love, family, fellowship and maybe drinking
       some eggnog. I urge everyone to not focus on presents, but to take some 
       time about what their friends and family mean to them this holiday season.
