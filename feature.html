        <div class="col-md-4">Fond du Lac High School students performed three sold out concerts at the FHS PAC on the 8th through the 10th
        of December this year to support a city-wide tradition. The Night of Silence Concert is performed for one weekend in December each 
        year to recognize the holiday season. It is a combined concert between the Fond du Lac High School Concert Choirs, Symphonic 
        Orchestra, SWaP band and the Cardinal Singers.

       <div class="col-md-4">The concert has become an important tradition in many families lives. There were many people hoping to 
       get into the concert, but weren't able to for that reason. The school livestreamed the event on the 
       <a href="http://www.fonddulac.k12.wi.us/">School District Website</a>. You can watch the livestream archive either in the window
       to your right. The livestream can continue to provide the holiday experience for those who were not able to attend and would 
       have liked to view the performance.
         <br><br>
       The stage at the high school was decorated with more than three hundred twenty poinsettias, all of which the students sold. 
       This year was the highest selling year, with a new record of poinsettias sold by one student. Dawson Wyrobeck sold a high 
       thirty-five poinsettias which trumped the previous twenty-nine.

       <div class="col-md-4">
           The holiday tradition was brought together through the efforts of all of the music program. Throughout the holiday program,
           the music brought people to a common interest and allowed for a fifteen year long tradition to be kept alive.
