           <h1 id="title">Mall Santa Saves Child From Peanut Allergy</h1>
       <div class="col-md-4"><img src="pictures/santa.png"><br>A mall Santa saved a child from a dangerous peanut allergy
       this Saturday, by injecting his epipen while his mother wasn't around. Carl Reedsly
       has been working as a mall Santa for five years now. He says that he does it for the
       kids. He loves seeing the smiles on their face when they come to see Santa. Billy 
       Jones has an allergy to tree nuts, and always carries his epinephrine pen. He was 
       the last kid in line to see Santa on December 9th, and his pen was one of the only 
       things that saved him.

       <div class="col-md-4">Billy Jones came to the mall to tell Santa that he wanted a
       new bicycle for Christmas. About halfway through the line, his mother needed to
       leave to use the bathroom. The boy in front of him in line offered Billy a peanut
       butter and jelly sandwich. Billy's peanut allergy started affecting him right away
       first slurring his speech.<br><img src="pictures/epi.png"><p font-size="10px">An epinephrine auto injector</p>
        </div>
       <div class="col-md-4">Next, Billy started to break out in hives. Carl Reedsly, the
       local mall Santa, noticed the kid start to turn red. He rushed over to Billy and
       patted the kid down to see if he had an epipen. He found Billy's auto injector, and
       injected Billy. After Billy was taken to the hospital, Carl came to his room as a 
       visitor, dressed in his Santa costume. Billy was able to tell Santa his Christmas 
       wishes and thank the man who saved him all at once. Billy and his mother have both
       expressed their gratitude greatly, and even bought him his own Christmas gift, a 
       brand new Christmas sweater with the Planters&#9400; logo in a Santa costume.
